Rodent III Personality Editor

Small project with Win32/Win64 binaries to configure Rodent III chess engine (http://www.pkoziol.cal24.pl/rodent/rodent.htm) personalities.

In order to run, the .db3 file must be in the same directory as the .exe file.

Features:
- Comments can be added for individual options.
- When saving, the initially opened file is backed up with date and time stamp.
- Right-clicking allows removing options and adding them back (comments would of course be lost).
- Shows basic information about the options, copied from Pawel's help files.

Rodent III is a very interesting engine for play and experimentation due to its editable personalities.  Obviously a lot of work has been done to create the many personalities.  Hopefully, this tool will help people continue developing and improving Rodent's personalities.

Many thanks to Pawel Koziol for writing Rodent III.
